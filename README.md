✨ My journey so far ... 
- Picked up C# coding some time ago. I'm self taught and doing it for fun. I have tried building a couple of console apps in visual studio,
i.e. this simple "Four-in-a-row" game [link]. I also recently joined the Advent of code [https://adventofcode.com/2022/]. Loads of fun to solve the puzzles (even though my codes may be far from efficient at the task ;) 

👋 Se you around!
