✨ My journey so far ... 
- Picked up C# coding some time ago. I'm self taught and doing it for fun. I have built a couple of console apps in Visual studio and tried Unity a bit. I also joined the "Advent of code". Loads of fun to solve the puzzles (even though my codes may be far from efficient at the task ;) 

👋 Se you around!
